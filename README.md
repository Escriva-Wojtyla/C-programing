2nd of June, 2025.
I have begun learning C.
Today I learnt about the basic data types: Floats, Integers, Characters.
I also learnt about the stdio library for taking user input, and how C handle different kinds of user inputs.
I also learnt about embedded format codes, and the difference between referencing a value and a memory address(Call by reference and call by value)
When referencing the address of an array in the scan function, an amber sign isn't used. I intend to find out why.
Cheers!
